    I would enable me to review my thought process when working on a project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a

    Pros: you can make commits of your project in logical part
    Cons: you may forget to commit at all

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    for git the working place of the user spans over multiple files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    reviewing your history

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    for my projects
