What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repostiry you are given the tools to start tracking the folder - commit changes, review the history.
You have to explicitly say that you need a repository in the current folder since by default you might not wish to create a repository in every folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a different concept. It gives us a way to say which changes to files to commit
